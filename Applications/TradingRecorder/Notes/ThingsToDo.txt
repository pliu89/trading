--- Ambre      ------------------------------
1. Allow the Excel RTD to set the particular IP address to listen instead
of using local host.

2. Allow user to completely delete a FillHub from Ambre by right-clicking and choosing destroy, say.
	Should delete the current drop file for this hub, but also the config file entry.

3. FIX!! The new fill listener creation button!  So, its clicked by system at construction time (to set things properly)!
	

--- Breconcile ------------------------------

Additional features
1. When a position appears in either Ambre-statement or clearing-statements, and there is no offsetting position in another statement, there are two cases to consider:  Its a product not tracking in one of our statements, or our position is off.  
	If there is NO knowledge of the offsetting product call this "unknown position", if there is a partial offset call this "unrconciled".
	This way, the fact that RCG does not clear BTec positions, these lines in Ambre will be "unknown" not "unreconciled"
	
2. New Task: Fill matching
	When there is a mismatch in the reconcilliation, perform and extra task.
	New task is to load the RCG fill statements and load the entire collection of fills from Ambre.
	Compare the two and report exactly who is missing which fills, 
	Example output message:
	* Extra RCG fill: +10 @ 99.095  LocalTime: Oct-20-2013 7:01:32 PM  ExchangeTime: Oct-21-2013 1:01:31 AM
